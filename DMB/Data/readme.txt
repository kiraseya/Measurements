All measurements can be found as csv or as .mat files.

Files names indicate the floor on which the measurements were taken (UG 1 or UG2
- the ground floor and basement floor, respectively), the frequency of the 
measurements (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz) and the antenna position (1 or 2).

In the dmb_data.m file the parameters for the different walls and the antenna 
coordinates can be found. The antenna coordinates are defined for each dataset. 

For more information about where and how the measurements were taken, see [cite paper].
