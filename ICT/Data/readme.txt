Data is in csv or .mat format

File names indicate the cube in which the measurements were taken (ICT1 or ICT2),
the frequency of the measurements (2.4 GHz or 5.8 GHz), the antenna position (1 or 2),
and finally the doorsclosed measurements were taken with the door to the rooms closed.

In the ict_cubes_data.m file the parameters for measurements and from the antenna
can be found, and in ict_cubes_layout you can find all the walls defined.
The antenna coordinates are defined for the different data sets. 

For more information about where and how the measurements were taken, see [cite paper].
